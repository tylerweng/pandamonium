# Pandamonium

[Pandamonium][pandamonium] is a strategic matching game inspired by Panda Jam
in which the objective is to get the panda home safely. By clicking on a
tile, all connected tiles of the same color get destroyed if there are 3
or more contiguous tiles present. The player loses if they run out of moves.

Pandamonium is a personal project by Tyler Weng.
